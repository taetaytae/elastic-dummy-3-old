# ED-003 (Elastic Dummy)

An interactive audiovisual webpage showcasing spatial HRTF panning through a 3D environment. Made using React Three Fiber to handle the visuals, Tone.js to handle the audio, and zustand to handle state management. 

Still a work in progress, the project's current barebones state can be seen here (works better with headphones): https://vimeo.com/687757763

New line of code. Handlebar.
